# INTRODUCTION TO R

## Learn to access, organise, analyse and argue with data using R

This workshop provides an overview of key concepts for creating an effective data driven project, and introduces tools and techniques for data wrangling, visualisation and reproducible reporting using R, a public domain language for data analysis. The R language provides a rich and flexible environment for working with data, especially data to be used for statistical modelling or graphics.

There is no a definitive way for carrying out data analysis. It rather depends on the study domain and the insights you wish to extract from the data that you have collected. This case study serves to learn from and to be inspired by for your data journeys. It includes a short step-by-step tutorial that teaches you how to progress with a wide variety of R techniques for converting data into actionable insights.
